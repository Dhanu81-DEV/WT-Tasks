    <h2>Rating:</h2>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">4.8/5</p>
    <h2>Movie Description:</h2>
    <p>
        Gabbar Singh is a 2012 Indian Telugu-language action comedy film directed by Harish Shankar.<br>
        The film is a remake of the 2010 Hindi film Dabangg and stars Pawan Kalyan and Shruti Haasan.<br>
        The plot follows a police officer who embarks on a mission to take down a corrupt politician.<br>
        Devi Sri Prasad composed the film's music and Jayanan Vincent was the cinematographer.<br>
  </p>

  <h2>Review:</h2>
    <p>
        Pawan Kalyan’s fans will have a very enjoyable time while watching Gabbar Singh. <br>
        The movie has good comedy, superb dialogues and some very entertaining episodes from Pawan. <br>
        A faster second half and a better climax block would have really elevated the film. <br>
        Still, the sheer brilliance of the first half and a sterling performance from Pawan make Gabbar Singh a solidly entertaining watch.<br>
        Thumbs up for Gabbar Singh.<br>
  </p>

  <h2>Plus points:</h2> 
  <p>
    Pawan Kalyan is simply outstanding in the role of Gabbar Singh and he delivers beautifully on all counts. <br>
    Pawan Fans will go into raptures of delight with his comedy, punch dialogues and mannerisms.<br> 
    He is excellent as always in the action sequences and he has performed some mass dances this time around.<br>
  </p>  

  <h2>Minus points:</h2> 
  <p>
    Ajay has a very small role and does not have much to do. Same goes for Kota Srinivasa Rao.<br>
    Except for the ‘Mandu Babulam’ song, he does not have any significant role in the film. <br>
    There have been some major changes in the script, particularly in the second half and perhaps, the original storyline from Dabangg should have been used.<br> 
    Tanikella Bharani’s role does not do justice to his talent.<br>
  </p>
